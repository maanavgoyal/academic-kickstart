### Biography

I am a mechanical engineering student, but I really find my mechanics class the best place to sleep. I like solving real-world problems based on machine and deep learning, but research is not where I belong. Apart from this, I could be seen streaming Netflix or scrolling Instagram.

### Interests

- Deep Learning
- Machine Learning
