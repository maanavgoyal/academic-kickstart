### Biography

I am a tiny little human being interested in playing with deep neural networks (and a lot of other things). Specific areas of interest include active learning, weak learning and adversarial perturbations. In my free time, I like listening to music and watching tech videos on youtube. I have been a part of VLG since September 2018 and the journey has been wonderful since then. <3
