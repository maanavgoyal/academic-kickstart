### Biography

I enjoy using mathematics and computational tools in applied settings to solve challenging problems of scientific and societal value. I am passionate about research in embodied agents and multimodal deep learning. I also happen to be a football fanatic and a music geek. Unpopular opinion - post Syd Pink Floyd is miles better than with Syd :)
