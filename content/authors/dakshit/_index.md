### Biography

Hi! I am Dakshit, currently a Research Engineer at Rephrase.ai where I get to work on a cool AI tech which lets you convert text to videos! I recently graduated from IIT Roorkee with a major in Computer Science. 

During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to be the Co-President of VLG, the Treasurer of ACM IIT Roorkee Student Chapter, and a member of the Mobile Development Group. I also got an opportunity to visit some great places to do research in AI, namely, Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki's group at Carnegie Mellon University, Prof. Venkatesh Babu's group at Indian Institute of Science, and Prof. Marco Pedersoli's group at École de Technologie Supérieure.

Besides the everyday bustle of my job, I juggle my time between playing the guitar, managing my financial portfolio, reading novels, watching TV series, or just hanging out with my family and friends. Feel free to get in touch if you wanna have a chat!
